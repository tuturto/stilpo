What is stilpo?
===============

Stilpo is a generic ai library for Hy, although at least parts of it should be
usable by Python programs too. It is based on ideas explained in excellent

<http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/bps/readme.html>`_.

`Stilpo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilpo>`_ was also a greek philosopher,
